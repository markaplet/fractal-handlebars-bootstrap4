### Conveying meaning to assistive technologies

Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as using `badgePreContent` and `badgePostContent` to inject accessible additional text hidden with the `.sr-only` class. 

## Pill Badges
Use the `.badge-pill` modifier class to make badges more rounded (with a larger border-radius and additional horizontal padding). Useful if you miss the badges from v3.
