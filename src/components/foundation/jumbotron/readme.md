# Jumbotron
[Jumbotron on Bootstrap 4 Wiki](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/jumbotron/)

This component has little structure that can be guarenteed, and will likely change dramatically from project to project. 
Since jumbotron is little more than a container div, all inner html is injected at run time. 

## API
* `jumbotronModifier` (optional): Used for adding any decorator classes such as `.jumbotron-fluid`.
* `jumbotronHTML` (Optional): Any valid HTML such as header, paragraphs, and buttons.
